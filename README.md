Spam Email Detection

This project is a simple **Spam Email Classifier** built using Python.  
It uses the `spam.csv` dataset to classify emails as **spam** or **ham (not spam)**.  
The project includes a Python script (`app.py`) for running the model and a simple HTML file (`index.html`) for displaying results.
